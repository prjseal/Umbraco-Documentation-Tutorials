# Umbraco-Documentation-Tutorials
A project for me to follow along with the tutorials in the Umbraco Documentation

## Current Completed Tutorials

1. [Creating a Property Editor](https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/Tutorials/Creating-a-Property-Editor/)

2. [EditorModel Events](https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/reference/events/EditorModel-Events)

3. I added my own property editor for getting the cover image of a YouTube Video, just from putting the YouTube link in. It's not finished yet.
